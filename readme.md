DOM batcher provides a way for you to add DOM read functions and DOM writes functions to a batch. When the end of the synchonous flow is reached, all the DOM reads are executed, then all the DOM writes. This is useful as DOM reads after DOM writes require the DOM to recompute layout which is expensive. Doing all your DOM reads, then all your DOM writes is the most efficient way of dealing with the DOM.
